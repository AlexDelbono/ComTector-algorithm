	\item[\emph{Definition 1}]: $S \subseteq V(G)$,$ \forall u , v \in S, u \neq v$, such that $(u,v) \in E$, then $S$ is a clique in $G$. If any other $S'$ is a \textbf{clique} and $S' \supseteq S$ iff $S' = S$, $S$ is a \textbf{maximal clique} of $G$.
\vskip 0.5cm	
	\item[\emph{Definition 2}]: For a given vertex $v$, $N(v) = \{ u | (v,u) \in E(G) \}$. We call $N(v)$ the set of all \textbf{neighbors} of $v$. Given a set $S \subseteq V(G)$, ${N|}_S = \bigcup N(v_i) - S$, $v_i \in S$, ${N|}_S$ is the set of all neighbors of $S$.
\vskip 0.5cm
	\item[\emph{Definition 3}]: Let $Com(G)$ be the set of all components in $G$. The giant component is denoted by $C_G$ and $M(C_G)$ is the set of all the maximal cliques in $C_G$. We use $V_M \subseteq V(G)$ to represent the set of all vertices  covered by $M(C_G)$.

For any pair of $P_i$ and $P_j$, if $|E(P_i)| > |(N|_{P_i} \cap P_j)|$, $P_i$ is defined as a \textbf{community} of $G$.

If $C_i$ is not contained by any other element in $C$, $C_i$ is called the \textbf{kernel} of $G$ and $v_i$ is the \textbf{center} of $C_i$

%Loading the graph and finding all the components of the network is quite simple because ComTector operates on undirected network without self loops that are typical of social networks. 
%\begin{block}{Component}
%In graph theory, a \textbf{connected component} (or just component) of an undirected graph is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph. \footnote{From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia}

%Now we have to agglomerate partitions in order to increase the \emph{Network Modularity Q}.
%\vskip 0.5cm
%$E = [ e _{ij}]$ is $p \times p$ symmetric matrix.
%\vskip 0.5cm
%$e_{ij}$ is the fraction of all edges in the network that link vertices in community $i$ to vertices in community $j$.
%\vskip 0.5cm
%Let $a_i = \sum e_{ij}$ be the sum of the $i$-th row.
%\vskip 0.5cm
%So the modularity is: $$Q = \sum_{i=0}^{p-1} (e_{ii} - {a_i}^2)$$

%\begin{frame}{Modularity optimization}
%\vskip 0.5cm
%To optimize the modularity the authors propose a greedy algorithm.
%\vskip 0.3cm
%We iteratively search for the changes $\Delta Q$ resulted from the amalgamation of each pair of communities, choose the largest of them, and perform the corresponding amalgamation until $\Delta Q$ becomes negative.
%\vskip 0.3cm
%$\Delta Q$ is defined as following:
%$$\Delta Q = \begin{cases} a_{ij} - {a_{(ij)}}^2+ {a_i}^2 + {a_j}^2, & \mbox{if } i,j\mbox{ is connected} \\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

%Where:
%\vskip 0.3cm
%$a_i = \frac{E_i}{m}$

%$m$ is the number of edges in the graph.

%$E_i$ is the number of edges in community $i$.
